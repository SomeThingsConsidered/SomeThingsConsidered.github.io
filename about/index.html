	<p>I have been working in data analysis and predictive modeling for nearly 20 years. I've previously worked in environmental economics (at <a href="http://www.rff.org/"a>Resources for the Future</a>) and building behavioral scorecards for credit card portfolios (at Providian Financial).  I currently work at CoreLogic, a real estate data and analytics company.  I've worked on a range of models during my 10+ years there, including <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/products/riskmodel.aspx" a>mortgage prepayment and default models</a>, <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/products/corelogic-hpi.aspx"a>house price indices</a> and <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/products/corelogic-hpi-forecasts.aspx" a> forecasts</a>, <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/products/geoavm-cascade-suite.aspx" a>Automated Valuation Model (AVM)cascades</a>, <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/products/loansafe-appraisal-manager.aspx" a>appraisal risk</a> and <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/products/loansafe-collateral-manager.aspx"a>collateral risk</a> models.</p>
	
	<p> My background is in economics, but I'm very interested in the interaction between econometrics and machine learning (e.g. <a href="http://zmjones.com/static/data/varian-wp-2014.pdf" a> Varian, Hal R. "Big data: New tricks for econometrics." The Journal of Economic Perspectives (2014): 3-27. )</a> </p>
