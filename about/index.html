<div class="blurb">

	<p>I have been working in data analysis and predictive modeling for nearly 20 years. I've previously worked in environmental economics (at Resources for the Future) and credit card risk (at Providian Financial).  I currently work at CoreLogic, a real estate data and analytics company.  I've worked on a range of models during my 10+ years there, including mortgage prepayment/default models, house price indices and forecasts, Automated Valuation Model (AVM)cascades, and appraisal risk models.</p>
	
	<p> My background is in economics, but I'm very interested in the interaction between econometrics and machine learning (e.g. Varian, Hal R. "Big data: New tricks for econometrics." The Journal of Economic Perspectives (2014): 3-27. ) </p>
