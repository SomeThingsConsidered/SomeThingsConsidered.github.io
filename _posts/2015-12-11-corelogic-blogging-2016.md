One of my goals in 2016 it to contribute on a regular basis to the <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/blog/#.VmrwKBorKgQ" a> economic and real estate blog </a> at work.  The company doesn't allocate much time for independent research, but it's possible to write blog posts that relate to analysis performed as part of the job.  For example, I've drafted a few posts related to property tax delinquency rates and mortgage servicer performance, which should be published in early 2016.  It's also possible to use 'nights and weekends' to write something that is less directly tied to my 'day job'. Given CoreLogic's wealth of data, there are a lot of interesting questions that can be investigated.  One of the first things that I'd like to write about is using realtor comments in MLS data to improve home price estimation.  Hopefully, I will be able to publish a few blogs on that topic in early 2016.
