I have very little experience working with web pages, but there is a lot of available info about using Jekyll and Poole to create a site on Github. I used <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/" a>  Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub </a> by Jonathan McGlone for the initial setup of this site.
