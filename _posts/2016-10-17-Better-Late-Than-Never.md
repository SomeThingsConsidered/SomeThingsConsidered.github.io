title: "Insights Blog: Realtor Comments and Property Condition"
date: 2016-10-17

Back in July,  added an entry to CoreLogic's Insights blog looking at <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/blog/authors/matt-cannon/2016/07/turning-words-into-data-part-ii.aspx#.WATNupMrKgQ" a> realtor comments for distressed listings. </a>

I made a few changes compared to the earlier post, such as adding zip level control variables within the county.  In the previous post, words associated with neighborhoods dominated the bag of words model.  With the inclusion of zip dummy variables, the text variables were more likely to pick up property condition or amenity effects.
