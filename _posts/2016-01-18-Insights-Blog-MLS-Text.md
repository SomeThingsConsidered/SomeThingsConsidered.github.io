title: "Insights Blog: Realtor Comments and Hedonic Regression"
date: 2016-01-18

I recently added an entry to CoreLogic's Insights blog which examined <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/blog/authors/matt-cannon/2016/01/turning-words-into-data.aspx#.Vp1glXhcKeA" a> realtor comments and property listings. </a>  The analysis was fairly high level, but provided an introduction regarding how information contained in listing agent comments could improve house price estimation via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_regression" a> hedonic regression</a>.  Specifically, I regressed the log of house price against the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living space, and a bag of words based on the realtor comments.
