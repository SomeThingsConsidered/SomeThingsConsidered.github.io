This page contains an interesting application of social network analysis <a href="http://evelinag.com/blog/2015/12-15-star-wars-social-network/#.VnhBkXhcKeA" a>applied to characters in the Star Wars movies</a>.  I've had limited exposure to social network analysis, but I think that an interesting application could be examining home appraisal data.  Information on nearby homes used as comps for a subject property for sale could be used to evaluate how the homes are linked.  This could provide information on things like neighborhood boundaries.  Appraisers who select the comparable properties are familiar with the neighborhood, and may not select properties that are geographically close, but separated by other factors (e.g. school district, railroad tracks etc.).  An examination of properties that are geographically close but not closely related in terms of network analysis could provide insight into neighborhood boundaries.
