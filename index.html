	<h1>Some Things Considered</h1>
	<p>I'm a predictive modeler working at CoreLogic (a real estate data and analytics company).  I've set up this site to write about my participation in <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/blog/">CoreLogic's Insights Blog</a>, analytic excercises such as Kaggle, observations from work,  and related material.</p>
